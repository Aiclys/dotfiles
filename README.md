**Dotfiles**

Welcome to my qtile configuration files

(I am still fixing the rofi config as it's currently not compatible with the keybinds in the qtile config)

Download:

Step 1 (clone the repository):
```
git clone https://github.com/Aiclys/qtile-dotfiles ~/dots
```

Step 2 (create a backup):
```
cd ~/.config/qtile
touch config_back.py
cp config.py config_back.py
```
(do the same thing with your other files if needed)

Step 3 (move the files into your .config directory):
```
mv ~/dots/qtile ~/.config/qtile
```
